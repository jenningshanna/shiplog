A few weeks ago my mother-in-law forwarded me an article in the NYTimes.com. It was about single-family zoning in American cities. It's a converstaion we've been having about how unaffordable where we live is (I live in West Los Angeles, Venice specifically, a community that's at the front lines of a housing crisis). 

The article is _[Cities Start to Question an American Ideal: A House With a Yard on Every Lot)](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html)_, written By _Emily Badger_ and _Quoctrung Bui_ for the _[Upshot](https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot)_. The article begins with these maps:

The significance of those maps is that they were made with Urban Footrpint, an Urban Planning product I designed years ago at Calthorpe Analytics in Berekely, Ca. 

It's not every day you get so say you did something that ended up in the New York Times. A colleage told me once that you either end up on the frontpage because you did something really dumb or you died in a plane crash. Well, I did something good and still go there! Boooyaahhhh

Here's the digital homepage:
