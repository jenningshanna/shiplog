This is what I imagine my colleagues telling me if I were to ask this question: Why do indy games have better sites?

###EXIBIT A - BELOW
For example, one of my absolute favorites, [Below](http://www.whatliesbelow.com/) (there's also an easter egg in this site involving a shooting star).

This site does something I've actually never seen any other site do. Ever. Did you catch it? If not, go back and keep scrolling. 

Okay, did you notice you can keep scrolling infinitely? Pretty neat, right? What really makes this neat is that's exactly what the game Below is about. Your shipwrecked on an island with only a dungeon to crawl. The halls and twisting caverns are generated dynamically so you never really visit the same place twice. But here's the twist, when you die in this game you start over, shipwrecked. With nothing. Though you may find the body of the your past  adventurer and in this case, loot it.

If you can't tell I love the premise of this game. I've been excited for many years to play it! And to be completely one hundred percent transparent, Below is special for a gaming website standpoint. As someone who builds websites and works in the gaming industry I cannot give you another single example of a game website that is as interesting as this.

###EXIBIT B - NIGHT IN THE WOODS
Here's another example. [Night In The Woods](http://www.nightinthewoods.com/)

Let's take inventory of some of the types of content on this site:

* A trailer front and center that is hosted on YouTube (industry standard). 
* An icth.io integration that allows you to buy the game right here, right now (and accepts BitCoin, because you know, we all buy our software in BitCoin now). 
* A simple blurb with the pitch of the game and a little tid bit about how they came about making it (indies have to do this I guess cause these things are a labor of love?). 
* A string of links to shit like emailing and twittering, that is admit-tingly hard to decipher, but notice... 
* A BANDCAMP link! Where you can buy the soundtrack for all of TWO DOLLARS! 
* A link to a shop, where you can buy cool t-shirts and whatnots to make your trapper keeper look cooler. 
* Accolades. Reviews matter and are human. If you are selling a product, they help when they are positive. 
* A gallery, because like the trailer being first up above, converting a viewer to a buyer is about showing gameplay. And this gallery features GIFs. Like a cat-tastic tumblr page my cousin stood up in 2006.
* A few confusing sections about prototypes they made before they finished the game. They could probably do without these.
