### For Immediate Release

Check it out! I created a Altus Cosmic site! 

I've been really busy making shit and finally I made something worth sharing. We'll continue to put the comics on instagram but wanted to house them in a way that conveys we are the creators. Also, help build some search awareness maybe through google?

Either way the site is live and the comic is too. (Just takes longs breaks)
