Family

- On November 21st at 12:02am our second son was born, Rider Paisley Hanna
- Quiller Beneze Hanna turned two in August and is very much a two year old

I wrote a bit about him recently [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-11-27-forgetting-time %}).

- Erin and I celebrated our 4th Wedding Anniversary

We haven't been back to Allerton since we were married and I regret not doing so over the last few weeks, as we have been back in Illinois staying with the in-laws for support with the new baby. I also just spelled married wrong, I corrected it but fuck me.

- We took a family trip to Colorado with the Hanna clan. 

There were like 12 of us. It was chaos. But fun. I stumbled upon a very nice beer bottle.

Work
- I traveled to Vancouver three times, the Bay Area three times, Stockholm twice, Orlando twice, Minneapolis twice, Edmonton twice, Austin once, Chicago once, Sacramento once, Charolette once, and Denver once
- We launched BFV to a mixed results, I play it and think it's a pretty damn good game
- We are launching Anthem in Feburary
- My work has been focused on developing the online publishing capabilities of our newly minted Newsroom team

Miscellaneous Shit

- re-designed my blog
- designed my first wine bottle, really first bottle of any sort for our friends at [Marshak Winery](www.marshakwinery.com)
- made some cool space posters that I have no idea what I am going to do with
