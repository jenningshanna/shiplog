I put this shiplog together many years ago. It's built using GitHub and Jekyll. It's an amazing open-source publishing software that uses Markdown and can be configured however I like. When I am ready to make an update or a post I simply push the code to a GitHub repo and call it day.

In a way I feel like I've neglected my power to code, or modify code to my liking. Since I was young I loved to tinker with things. I was always rebuilding something; and now I see my kids always rebuilding things too. It's so wonderful to be a person obsessed with making and tinkering. It's a mindset that is freeing from the always oppresive nature of not understanding how things *actually* work.

Today I'm looking to reignite this shiplog. I'd like to commit to a daily (or more likely simi-daily) ritual of making a post here.

On most days I'm going to to very little and share an accountability post. On other days I am going to write a long essay on the meaning of life and the termoils of childbearing, working in tech, and being a designer (or doing anything in our society that is adstract).

The accountability post will look something like this:

- What I am working on today?
- What support do I need to get that done?
- What feelings do I have about it?
- Where do I expect to get it today?

That's it to start. Wish me luck on this journey of sharing more and being open!

All my best,

~ Jennings
