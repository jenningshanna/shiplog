I put this shiplog together many years ago. It's built using [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It's an amazing open-source publishing software that uses Markdown and can be configured however I like. When I am ready to make an update or a post I simply push the code to a GitHub repo and call it a day.

In a way I feel like I've neglected my power to code, or modify code to my liking. Since I was young I loved to tinker with things. I was always rebuilding something; and now I see my kids always rebuilding things too. It's so wonderful to be a person obsessed with making and tinkering. It's a mindset that is freeing from the always oppresive nature of not understanding how things *actually* work.

Today, I'm looking to sail this ship and rekindle this shiplog. I never stopped creating (sailing) but I'd like to commit, right freaking now, to a daily (or more likely semi-daily) ritual of making a post here. *pinky promise*

On most days I'm going to share very little and simply conjure an accountability post. On other days, I'll write a long essay on the meaning of life and the turmoils of childbearing, working in tech, and being a designer (or doing anything in our society that is abstract).

The accountability post will look something like this:

- What I am working on today?
- What support do I need to get that done?
- What feelings do I have about it?
- Where do I expect to get it today?

That's it to start. Wish me luck on this journey of sharing more and being open!

All my best,

~ Jennings
