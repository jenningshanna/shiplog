The first title published by the behemoth video game corporation was Skate or Die in 1987, for the Commadore-64. Many people don’t know this or think this when they hear EA or EA SPORTS _it's in the game_. If you haven’t played Skate or Die you aren’t missing out on much. It was an impossibly hard simulator of halfpipe, downhill, and gladiator like pool fighting skateboarding. If you were really talented (or just spent way too much time playing it) you’d maybe land a handstand. Back in those days games were ametuer. It was the beginning. Just happens that those days were the also the early days of Silicon Valley in general.

You see EA was founded in 1982 by Trip Hawkins, while he was working for this other corperation you may have heard of called Apple Inc.. It’s the classic Silicon Valley story you've heard on repeat since computers became cool sometime around the late 1990s. One of a Stanford graduate starting a dreamy computer software company. Skate or Die was the earliest offering. Seems more fitting to the San Francisco of yesteryear than today.

But my story isn’t about Skate or Die, Trip, or the history of EA and Silicon Valley. Rather it’s about my love of gaming and video games, my experience working for the company and in an industry I adore. This is about what I did, how it effected the business and myself, and where I think I am headed now. Before you read further, know that this is in memoritorium and is a therapy of sorts for myself and nothing more or less. The opinions expressed in this piece are my own and obviously are not warranted or sponsored by Electronic Arts or their studios or partners. I was laid off from EA in a mass layoff a few months ago, April of 2019.

<em>A boy finding his love for video games</em>
</div>

Sometime around 1987 a starry eyed little boy, born in (and of) the early 80s zietgiest— found his love of video games. There was something wrong with little boys in this era that didn't play video games. Friends were ranked on they’re cartridge collections and completion percentages of epics like Metroid or Final Fantasy III. I was so endeared with the medium I would routinely meet up with a friend to design our own Mega Man maps. We did so with a pencil on grid paper. He'd focus on the boss and I would create the level. At nine years old so we didn’t have computers yet and even if we had had computers the 8-bit programming that made up these early games would have been super challenging. This is why Skate or Die sucked to play and took five years to develop. Remember EA started in '82 and published it's first title in '87.

Early on video games were relentlessly hard to play. Just ask anyone who beat Goblins and Gouls or PunchOut. They weren’t responsive enough. They were laden with bugs and holes. Most of them hard coded and if they crashed or you spilled juice on the cartridge, the game and the save state were gone forever. There were no backups or redundancies, just a good old piece of plastic with some chips in it. It might as well have been a cesset tape rewinding and forwarding on command. 

Growing up in the 80s I was one of the many who day dreamt about playing video games, drew video games maps and characters in class, and acted out scenes from them in my pretending time. As I grew older the games grew with me. They got more angsty in the 90s when Mortal Combat was obsessed with _Fatalities_ and Twisted Metal filled afternoons with missiles exploding out of an evil ice-cream truck. Later I found storytelling of the likes I’d never seen before in Final Fantasy VII and Chrono Trigger. (Both still widely conidered two of the best games ever.) As an adult, my brother and I love for football still manifest in regular Madden bouts, which no matter how long it’s been since one of us played, are almost always too close to call.

Once out of college and onto the dropship of adult life I found community in a game called World of Warcraft. Like most departing from college my friends and I had been dispersed across the country. One way we stayed together was to hang out and kill murlocks in the virtual world of Azeroth. (Insert murlock grumbling sound.) For those of you not familiar with WoW, it’s a online game that is filled with real people playing trolls and paladins and other fantasy types. There were many late nights of raiding, or just talking about raiding. We built a guild with a website. We farmed items and put them in a bank for our members to utilize to play advanced end-game content. We were a fellowship of gamers. A collective in search of the same goals. To beat bosses, really really fun (not important) goals... Being silly and having fun is why we play games!

<h1>Getting in the game</h1>
<em>How I got into the industry</em>
</div>

You can imagine my response when I got a phone call from a previous colleague asking if I wanted to join them at Electronic Arts. I was ecstatic! But, it had been a while since I had played any games. My WoW days ended as my friends started to drop in to life and do adulting things, like have kids or take responsibly for their careers. I had done the same. I'd pursued and completed my master's degree in New York and soon after moved to LA. Then the Bay Area to work in tech. I no longer had time to consume video games, at least I thought. I said yes to come to EA. There was no thought, I knew I wanted to Skate or Die.

My friends that played WoW with me were my community. We still kept in touch. Nowadays texting each other, but in touch none the less.

Subsequently my wife and my 6 month old son moved back to Los Angeles and settled in. I started soon after at EA as an Editor-in-Chief, Editorial Strategist. A fancy title but simple task, I supported the editorial and content teams in strategy and product implementatoin. That meant things like how to get data for articles from developers to how to amplify content through Google's AMP program.

The company was changing it's approach. A pivot of the variety of "content is king". EA had found itself stagnant in the market, making the same titles year over year to less fanfair. The market was good but their approach wasn’t sustainable and they knew it. Their response: create more content, better content, and a steady stream of it. Hence, we were brought on to create a newsroom. There was some vision. But not enough, some randome BCCs from higher ups of spuring “culurual moments” (still not sure what those are) or "executing with global reach”. A fast reminder that buzzwords and acroynyms and taskforces are not leadership. 

Our mission directive seemed simple though. We would build a media company inside a video game publishing company.

Upon arrival we were a team of three. Myself, my boss who I’d worked with before, and a senior manager from a devastated marketing team who was (I’d later find out) a last man standing of the multiple year culling the marketing departments had been laid to waste with. 

We were assisgned to look across the entire portfolio (12+ triple A games). An impossible task for three people. "Can you provide a centralized execution of content?". We'd do the best we could but we needed a team. There was a copy team and a content strategy team that we partnered with but we needed direct heads working with studios on specific titles (spoiler, we never got here). But we quickly absorbed the copy and content strategy teams. 

All the sudden we are twelve people. Still vastly underhanded.

So this was the first year. Really the honeymoon of any job, especially one that lights up your starry eyed nine year old self like this one did for me. We hit the ground, pounding our fist for with guinenly interesting work: 
* We made some beautiflul content rich sites for Mass Effect and Star Wars Battlefront II. 
* We were able to implemented GIFs and Data Journalism into our editorial. 
* We built Easter eggs and community driven content that were touched by communities of hundred of thousands of players. 
* We created kits and services for our audiences to use in creating their own content on their own channels. It was like playing baseball in the majors.
* We created a philosophical approach to telling human stories and acting as reporters to "stage and report". (sorry I know those are buzzwords, I'm not innocent either.) 
* We had a lense which we validated all our ideas through. * We built efficiencies across: 
    * publishing (both web and social)
    * CDNs 
    * content management 
    * analytics
    * and localization. 
    
* We wrote content strategies and held our publication to par against them. We were building… well.

**We had built (or we're well on our way to building) a media company.**

<h1>Getting up and brushing it off</h1>
<em>What we made</em>
</div>

Over the course of year one we built a team of nearly thirty. Composed of mostly copywriters, content strategist, and a few editorail staff. 

Out impact on the business was difficult to measure but we had our success (although subjective).

* We created editorial that is now standard practice for EA called the "this is" series
* We created an easter egg to engage players of Battlefield about the annouce of a new title. The response was that more than half a million people logged in concurrently to watch the annouce livestream.
* We created regular updates on sports titles like FIFA and Madden with daily twitch shows, custom web products, and regular updates from the developers
* We interviewed top FIFA, NBA, and NFL athletes and made full content peieces with them. Here are a few examples:
    * [Patrick Mahomes](https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-20/patrick-mahomes)
    * [Candice Parker](https://www.ea.com/en-au/games/nba-live/nba-live-19/news/candace-parker-interview)

<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;padding:45px 0;">
<h1>Watching out for narly</h1>
<em>Two reasons the video game industry is only going to get worse</em>
</div>

My perspective and a lot of those that have worked in gaming is that the gaming industry is rotten AF. What I mean by that I'll do my best to explain two-fold. 

* One - it's really hard to make video games at the expectations gamers have now. At least for AAA titles.

* Two - it's a tale we hear to often now of a business eating it's own tail and the business being at conflict as to how to move forward with it's product because it's to focused on how to make rediculous profits year over year. 

#### My first reason: The product is too difficult to make. It takes to much time and requires to much work and advanced knowledge of both 3D, annimation, and programming. 

Think about a fruit tree, an apple tree maybe. When it blossoms in the spring it’s pretty but hardly useful to it's owner. As the summer passes, its flowers begin to turn to fruit. In the fall the fruit is brilliantly ripe — calling to be plucked. In the 80s gaming was the blossoming tree entering the summer. Then the 90s the flower survived it's summer boom. And continuing into the 2000s to ripened to a fruit. 

As the industry grew and the games got remarkably better and more complicated, the business of making and publishing games growth was stunted. 

As for our apple tree? Well, it’s got rotting fruit hanging on the tree. Which is what I mean by the industry being rotten. 

Games have continued to be set at a price point of $60. Which was not enough to recoup the cost of making the thing. Publishers now, more and more, take on debt to build games and rely monetization on other ventures. These tactics are devisive and widely unliked. The industry calls them micro-transactions, you may have heard of a little things called _loot boxes_? Well this actually the premise of my next point.

#### My second reason: The business eating it's own tail and business being at conflict with itself.

The gaming industry is born of tech. As obviouse in Trip's voyage from Apple to starting EA fresh out of Stanford. Making games is software and making softare is tech work. Tech work right now in our post-modern age is, at it's most, a neandrathal. It's just learning to start fires not eat raw meat that kills itself.

Gaming, interestingly enough, is where the term “burnout” originated. Studios were renowned for crunch time and expectations of long hours were the dues you paid for working on something you love. Working in the industry is predicated by accepting a horrible work/life balance. 

The reason this can persist: accountability is non-existent. Leadership acts more like a conveyor belt for the loyal than rewarding those who actually listen to what people are saying. Look at the insane brain drain happening now at Activision because they laid off 800 people while giving a new CTO a massive bonus. People who built that company left and the games will suffer.

And I have a (what I think is rational) fear that the gaming industry has in it's wake built a dark army of people that are difficult to work with because they accept the trauma I've been diving into. I hope I am wrong.

<em>What did I think I was getting into?</em>
</div>

> Skate / Die / Start Over

When Tripp founded EA he wanted to make _electronic art_. _I think_. I am not Trip and I have never met him so I can't validate that. But I think I can make the assumption. I imagine a young engineer at Apple thinking, "we could make art out of this software thing, interactive art". Simple if you think about it. Video Games are software interfaces that respond to your input and feedback. They're games, yes, but really, they are software first.

And like all software, there's a learning curve to usability. We call this the _users experience_. I am an interaction designer by training so let me quickly explain how long it actually took software to get a grip on what good interactions look like. 

Sometime around the late ninties, Steve Jobs met a fella named Cooper. Cooper was working on the interface design of medical equiptment used mostly in surgery. Extremely specific technology applications that require robust systemization and reliable output while also having cohesive and usable operations. They weren't  trying to "delight" a user back then. Instead, they were simply making sure your heart didn't stop while the doctor reads the manual to the diffibulator. The application of the users experience was paramount to the machine and software working properly.

Steve Jobs was, without skepticism, very interesetd in Cooper's work because he had heard of this concept of the users experience or academically HCI (Human Computer Interaction) that Cooper was using to help surgeons. Steve wanted to incorperate it into his products. Once the iPhone released as changed the world everyone wondered what the secret was to making such a ubiquitus product. It was the focus on the customer as a user. Not a transaction. And thus the creation of UX design and interaction design. 

Video games took the same path as the rest of silicon valley software junkiesL: From therassic software to jurrassic games to modern experiences. But unlike their neighbors, EA didn't take the interaction design and users experience very seriously. Instead they thought of the user as a transaction, and instrument of making money. This misstep led to them further and further down a capitalist pig spiral, eventually completely not giving a fuck and outright treating thier users as unlucky guest at a micro transactions surprise party.

What made video games so interesting to that starry eyed kid in the 80s is they were a fun way to learn. Interaction is about learning and skilling up. Meaninglessly. Being good at a game takes practice and focus, and I hate to mention it but like learning anything and being good at it, it takes patience. 

I had computer lab in school and we had a choice to play Math Crunchers or The Oregon Trail. We learned things like how to read and how to multiply from these games. The games gave us skills that we'd have otherwise learned through repetition and basic literacy. Instead we were able to apply the learning to an interaction that was engaging. So engaging in fact that if you ask anyone my age about these games they'll probably be able to share with you very specific examples of playing them. 

Jon Madden once said that his partnership making the most infamous football video game series of all time with EA was as a teacher first. His only requirement for the game was that it teach people the game of football. A little known fact is that Jon Madden was a teacher before he was a coach. He has a master's degree in education. And he taught for years at the colleagic level. Now doesn’t it just make sense why he would be one of the greatest coaches and announcers of all time? He taught me and the rest of America how the game of football works for over twenty years on Monday nights.

Video games have taught us how football works, places in the world, and historical artifacts while searching for the illusive Carmen San-Diego. Video games have brought the world together to solve puzzles in Myst and to bard tales of adventure at virtual pubs in Ultima Online. Eve, a massive multiplayer online game of spaceships, once had a completely organic civil war break out amongst its two largest player guilds.

![Skate or Die - GAME OVER](/images/skateordie/skateordie-5.gif)

<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;padding:45px 0;">
<h1>Game Over</h1>
<em>What I learned and where I'm at with all of this</em>
</div>

As I mentioned in the begining of this article I was laid off in a mass layoff not long ago. I have learned a lot from my experience at EA. It's actually very difficult to write about this because in all honesty I am still angry and resentful of the company. When I was laid off it wasn't just me it was a lot of folks that I had had a hand in hiring. I feel guilty, and responsible for not doing better to protect those people. A few of them have young kids and as a father with two young boys that bothers me the most. I strongly feel we have a larger responsibilty when we employ and work with others than just giving them a desk, paycheck, and healthcare. That we also have a responsiblity to keep them employed and keep those people and their families in good situations.

I've shared how I got into video games, how I ended up working for the largest video game company in the world, and what we did while I was there. I've told you story of how video games have grown in my lifetime, along side me. I've written about how software is at the root of all gaming. How my training and experience in UX and interaction design are fundemental to it's creation and how these methodologies in better application I believe can solve the industries problems. I've shared how learning is part of the process of playing games and why that's sticky.

In closing I am not sure where I am headed. Trip Hawkins wasn't sure where he was going either. I don't think I want to write another post in a few years about how I helped a company do all this stuff and then questions both the ethics and the sausage making of the business itself. With that in mind I don't think I'll be looking for work in the gaming industry. Instead I'm looking for work in something I can pay forward a little more. Something that less of a take and more of a give. Like governemt or global warming. Maybe financial wellness or healthcare.

You think Trip skating down the Santa Cruz boardwalk thought his electronic artistry company would become this? I’m sure he didn’t. Did that starry eyed boy getting up early on Saturday mornings to play video games ever think he’d be on the inside? I’m sure he didn’t either. I’ve learned a lot and have grown a lot from my experience. Most of the work we did was challenging and rewarding. And almost all of the people I worked with regularly were spectacular at what they did and kind doing it. I’ll always have fond memories of the time I spent at EA. And I wish all my colleagues the best going forward.

I'm _in the game_, y'all. 

Skate or die.
