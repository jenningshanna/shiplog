Well I find myself today looking back and reflecting on what wasn't. I didn't write much (for myself) in 2017. I wrote a lot of emails and briefs for my newish job, but not much of anything else.

I don't regret that. It's been a busy year for me. I started a little over a year ago working full time for a big video game company. Which has been fun but consuming due to a lot of travel. On top of that, my son is now one and half and quickly showing signs of toddler-hood.

With work I have traveled the world probably three times over and spent too much time on planes. I flew to Stockholm last fall twice. The second time, on the way home, I took up a whole row with some colleagues and we played Mario Cart as we soared over Greenland at 600 some miles per hour.

And my son, he is growing fast. He has an appetite for speed. Like his father I guess. I was asking my wife just yesterday when a kid is old enough to ice skate. She rolled her eyes at me.

Sometimes I take my son skateboarding. He stands on the tip of the board while I peddle from behind. I hold both his hands up as he sails the sidewalk. Have you ever heard a kinder sound than the squeal of excitement and terror spun in one?

When I travel I read the New Yorker. It's become a ritual. I used be able to work on planes, but now that I am on them so often I don't ever want to work. Instead, although I usually think I a going to play my Nintendo Switch and am a freak about charging it, I usually just read an article or two. The writing, style, and editorial standard comfort me about where I fear the world is headed.

For 2018 I want to focus in on a few things to learn and write about in detail. I find the focusing part though, hard to focus. I like being a jack of many trades but I heard this woman on the radio talking about making a list and going down it in order. So maybe if I focus I can then procrastinate on the prioritizing. 

Nobody will be surprised if I don't write much here this year, especially myself. But let's say I do. Let's say it's the best writing I've done ever. It's focused and prioritized. It's sincere and honest. It's about ten things I came up with at random and dropped here:

* Charcoal Grilling
* Beans
* History of Skateboarding
* Venice, Los Angeles
* Mescal
* Cappuccinos
* Metrics
* Audis
