Writing / Drawing / Making Stuff
- Designed my first wine bottle, really first bottle of any sort for our friends at [Marshak Winery](http://marshakwinecompany.com/). Check them out [on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/marshakwineco) too 
- Wrote about writing more to start the year and then wrote less. [Go figure]({% post_url 2018-03-11-writing %}).
- Wrote about indy games have better websites [here]({% post_url 2018-03-24-why-do-indy-games-have-better-websites %}).
- Thinking out loud about all the things I was going to do with paternity leave. [I did some of it]({% post_url 2018-10-13-do-i-draw %}).
- Wrote about watching my toddler interpret time. And put it into HTML columns (like those old things we called magazines) [here]({% post_url 2018-11-27-forgetting-time %}). The magazine styling is a fun new feature of HTML that requires no CSS. Something like this used to be really difficult to do well.
- Made some cool space posters that I have no idea what I am going to do with. [Spacey!]({% post_url 2018-12-28-space-posters %})

Family
- On November 21st, at approximately 12:02am, our second son was born! His name is Rider Paisley Hanna.
- Quiller Beneze Hanna (the oldest son) turned two in August and is very much a two year old. I wrote a bit about him [here]({% post_url 2018-11-27-forgetting-time %}).
- May 25th Erin and I will have been married FIVE years. She's lovely and I'm reminded every day by her love and kindness how lucky I am to have our matrimony.

Work
- We launched [BFV](https://www.battlefield.com/) to a mixed results. I've played it and think it's a pretty damn good squad based FPS game. It's also beautiful to look at.
- We are launching a few exciting things early this year. Of the ones I can talk about, [Anthem](https://www.anthemgame.com/), launches in February. Hopefully we will make up for some of our companies recent lows.
- My work specifically has been focused on developing the online publishing capabilities of our somewhat freshly minted Newsroom. My biggest accomplishment this year has been brokering a relationship with Google to build AMP capabilities into our publishing platform. If you don't know what AMP is take a look [here](https://www.ampproject.org/).

The Personal Brand
- Updated [jenningshanna.com](https://www.jenningshanna.com) with a EA box. Nothing in it yet but lots to document when I get around to it.
- Re-designed this site and really put a ton of work into it's structure. Wrote a bit about how it works under the hood [here]({% post_url 2019-03-10-how-this-works %}).
- Here's a little report on jenningshanna.com from my analytics.
