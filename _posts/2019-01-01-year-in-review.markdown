Family
- On November 21st at approximately 12:02am our second son was born! His name is Rider Paisley Hanna
- Quiller Beneze Hanna (our first son) turned two in August and is very much a two year old
- May will be Erin and I's 5 year wedding anniversary

Work
- I traveled to Vancouver three times, the Bay Area three times, Stockholm twice, Orlando twice, Minneapolis twice, Edmonton twice, Austin once, Chicago once, Sacramento once, Charolette once, and Denver once.
- We launched [BFV](https://www.battlefield.com/) to a mixed results. I play it and think it's a pretty damn good squad base FPS game.
- We are launching a few exciting things early this year. [Anthem](https://www.anthemgame.com/) in February. Hopefully they'll make up from some of the recent lows.
- My work specically has been focused on developing the online publishing capabilities of our newly minted Newsroom team.
-- the teams has grown to over 30

Miscellaneous

- made some cool space posters that I have no idea what I am going to do with. I'll share these later.
