###Areas prioritized:
####1. Activism —
Educating the consumer against feeling "guilt" for cabon footprint while also offering them direct action opportunities to facilitate change in large globalized processes.
#####2. Personal Responsibility —
Evaluating the impacts of framing climate change as the ["Lightbulb Problem"](http://jennings.ghost.io/thesis-pieces-an-overhead-view/). Finding a way to use personal/consumer guilt as a call to action for larger businesses to change their supply and manufacturing processes.
#####3. Measuring —
Not using arbitrary means of counting to evaluate something as vague as carbon output. Researching ‘cap'n trade’ like systems to see what's working and what's not. Creating an understanding of where these gamification/market-ification systems turn people away or lead to nefarious behaviors.

###Methods:
####For Activism and Personal Responsibility —
- Prototyping
	- Paper
    	- Post Cards
        - Posters
        - Report / Infographic
    - Application
    	- Ecommerce
        - Cartography
        - Brochure Site
    - Direct Action
    	- Contributions
        - Letters to policy makers
        - Volunteering
- Research
	- The "Light Bulb Problem"
    	- Framing
        - Empathy
        - Reversing Guilt

    	- Benefits for long term (everyone)
        - Benefits for short term (us)
        - Immediate benefits (me)
####For Measuring —

- Prototyping
	- Wearables (like a FitBit or FuelBand)
    - Goals (and outline to fulfill goals)
- Research
	- Time Map
    - Service Blueprint
    	- Map emotional relationship
        - Cross reference price/quality/quantity relationship
