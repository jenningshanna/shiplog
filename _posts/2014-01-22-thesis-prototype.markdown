####This is a reflection on the prototype shown in my fall semester Thesis II course in December of 2013. You can read in detail about the concept I presented in [my last post]({% post_url 2014-01-03-thesis-prototype %}).

**Strengths**:

- Graphics
- Storyline
- Concept
- Feel good/Uplifting
- Wide Focus
- Wicked Problem

**Weaknesses**:

- Too Shiney
- Story one-sided
- Making lot of Assumptions
- Not Grounded in Facts
- Disparate research
- Not synthesized, more constraints

###Areas to further explore:

In **Interaction**:

- Small Business Supply Chain Access (as of now)
- Enterprise Shipping Processes
- Booking/Brokering Processes
- Maritime Law
- Voice/Interest of Artisan Companies

In **Design**:

- Best Language to Use:
	- Not Selling Out Small Biz
    - Convincing Big Companies to Play
    - Consumer Trust/Brand Loyalty
- Simple Initiative/Brand/ Tagline
- Synthesized/Service Design Blueprint
- Angle/Perspective - Strict

In **Technical**:

- Coding (rails framework)
- Databases
- Cross Platform/Device Agnostic

What to **refine** and **iterate**?

- Consumer Interface
	- flow
    - wires
    - journeys
- Enterprise Interface
	- flow
    - wires
    - journeys
- Offline Interactions/Components
	- What are they?
    - Where are they needed?
- Strategy Towards Environmental Impact/Carbon Footprint
	- Define Need
    - Benefit and/or Value
    
What is **not yet explored**?

- Why beer? Why brewers?
- What does this look like at a *micro* level?
	- Locally?
    - Regionally?
- Deeper discussions with product makes of all kinds.

**UX-Overfocus**

- Popularity
- Combination of Consumer, Small Biz, and Enterprise
- Proximity to product being a factor
- Modularity, fitting all lifestyles

**UX-Underfocus** 

- Defining focus, actual need
- Scaling
- Fun factor and playfulness
