this is in short the existence<br/>
of two breaking gently.<br/>
the perspective of the past<br/>
is at best, shaking –<br/>
unresponsive to the traditional reaction<br/>
in a way that only the pair can explain.<br/>
while coinciding with one another,<br/>
the objects of desire are kept<br/>
behind lock and key,<br/>
for without,<br/><br/>

there’d be no reason for me.
