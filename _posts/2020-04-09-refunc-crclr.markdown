Been following a [friends](https://twitter.com/leylaacaroglu) adventures in sustainablity and design and came across these really cool places in Germany. [CRCLR](https://crclr.org/) is a hub for "circular economies" and [Refunc](http://refunc.nl) is an architecture/art shop that makes things out of re-used material. The core of both of these intities is to create with ZEOR WASTE. Super cool.

Check out this video of them working together to build a waste-less insulated shelter:
